      title:  A little about myself
      content:  |
              I am a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on accessibility, intuitive design, and turning ideas into practical, user-centered software.
              As a passionate advocate for seamless user experiences, I specialize in crafting interactive, high-performance front ends and scalable back-end solutions using the latest technologies and methodologies.
              My work is driven by a commitment to building intuitive interfaces that balance functionality, accessibility, and aesthetics.
              
              In my most recent role as a Front-End Developer at UW-S, where I worked for 4 years, I contributed to the development of an in-house narrowcasting system used across multiple supermarket brands in the Netherlands.
              This project allowed me to leverage technologies like React, TypeScript, and Vite to create dynamic, scalable interfaces and optimize the user experience across a broad audience.
              My contributions helped deliver a reliable and high-quality digital solution for a complex, multi-brand ecosystem.
              
              Earlier in my career, after graduating in 2015 with a B.A. Hons in Web Development from SAE Institute, London (Middlesex University), I worked as a Full-Stack Developer at AmeTrade for over four years.
              During this time, I gained experience with a diverse range of technologies and platforms, developing web applications using the LAMP stack and gaining valuable insights into full-stack workflows.

      title:  Skills & Tools 
      content:  |
              Currently, I work with a modern tech stack that includes JavaScript, React, Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and TypeScript. I also have experience with Supabase for authentication and storage, Zod for form validation, and WebSockets for real-time interactions.
              
              My expertise extends to headless CMS platforms like Strapi for building dynamic content systems and back-end solutions powered by MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
              
              Additionally, I use tools like ESLint and Webpack to maintain optimized and clean codebases.
              This portfolio itself is a static Progressive Web App (PWA), built using Gatsby for its superior performance and static site generation capabilities, hosted on Netlify with optimized workflows for fast, reliable delivery.

              My recent work reflects my growing interest in headless CMS solutions and CI/CD pipelines powered by platforms like Vercel and Netlify.
              
              I am passionate about leveraging these tools to streamline deployment workflows, deliver high-performing applications, and ensure scalability across diverse projects.
              
              Staying at the forefront of modern development practices remains a top priority as I continue to refine my craft and deliver impactful digital experiences.

                I am passionate about design and enjoy being actively creative, and believe I am a Interdesciplinary designer who likes to solve problems.
                I get out to exhibitions and events in a broad spectrum of creative media as often as possible.

      content:  |
                I own a Triumph Bonneville 1971 (bobber) motorcycle and a 1953 Chevrolet pickup 'Advanced Design' which I ride regularly.
                Elvira, the motorcycle (named after my Grandmother) was designed and built by my Father and myself.

                I lived in London, United Kingdom for over 15 years and moved to Den Haag, The Netherlands at the beginning of 2020. 
                When not sitting at the desk I enjoy live music or just watching car shows "GYSOT".
