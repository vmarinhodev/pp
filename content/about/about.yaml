                I am passionate about design and enjoy being actively creative, and believe I am a Interdesciplinary designer who likes to solve problems.
                I get out to exhibitions and events in a broad spectrum of creative media as often as possible.

      content:  |
                I own a Triumph Bonneville 1971 (bobber) motorcycle and a 1953 Chevrolet pickup 'Advanced Design' which I ride regularly.
                Elvira, the motorcycle (named after my Grandmother) was designed and built by my Father and myself.

                I lived in London, United Kingdom for the last 10 years and moved to Den Haag, The Netherlands at the beginning of 2020. 
                When not sitting at the desk I enjoy watching car shows "GYSOT".
