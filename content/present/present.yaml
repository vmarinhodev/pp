      title:  What I am Doing at the moment
      content:  |
              At the present moment I am a Front End Developer for UW-S, turning ideas into practical software.
              I've been part of the UW-s team since 2020, creating intuitive and compelling interfaces and developing fast interactive front ends, using the latest technologies and techniques.
              
              As a React frontend developer, I create and maintain the user interface of web applications using React.
              My role involves transforming design mockups and wireframes into functional, efficient, and visually appealing components.
              I work closely with designers to ensure the user interface aligns with the intended user experience and design specifications.
              
              I leverage Reactâ€™s component-based architecture to build reusable, modular components that manage their own state and handle interactions.
              Efficient state management is key, so I use libraries like Redux or React's Context API to handle complex application states and ensure smooth data flow throughout the application.
              
              A significant part of my job is integrating APIs and working with backend developers to maintain seamless communication between the front and back ends.
              This involves fetching, updating, and manipulating data as needed.
              
              I also focus on performance optimization by continuously monitoring and improving the application.
              Techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and memoization help keep the app fast and efficient.
              
              Testing and debugging are essential for delivering stable, reliable applications, so I write unit and functional tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
              Collaboration is important in my role, so I work closely with backend developers, designers, product managers, and other stakeholders to create cohesive and efficient web applications.
              
              Continuous learning is a part of my work, as I stay up to date with the latest libraries, tools, and best practices to deliver top-quality results.
              I manage and track changes using version control systems like Git and may also be involved in deploying front-end applications using CI/CD pipelines.
              
              Overall, my role as a React frontend developer is to create high-quality, performant, and user-friendly web applications that meet the needs of users and stakeholders alike.

      content:  |
              OctoCast is an innovative CMS that gives you control over a narrowcasting setup, whether it concerns one screen or hundreds.
              Rights management gives users the opportunity to post messages nationally, regionally or locally.
              For example, a head office can post nationally, while an entrepreneur with OctoCast can easily independently create and place local messages for his store.
              Naturally, our software is prepared for any desired screen size and video resolution.
