      content:  |
              At the present moment I am a Front End Developer for UW-S, turning ideas into practical software.
              I've been part of the UW-s team for the last two years, creating intuitive and compelling interfaces and developing fast interactive front ends, using the latest technologies and techniques.
              
              After graduating from SAE Institute, London (Middlesex University) in 2015 with a B.A. Hons in Web Development, I started working at AmeTrade where I've been working as a Full-Stack (LAMP Stack) developer for over 4 years.
              During my time there, I have worked with different languages, technologies and platforms.

              OctoCast is an innovative CMS that gives you control over a narrowcasting setup, whether it concerns one screen or hundreds.
              Rights management gives users the opportunity to post messages nationally, regionally or locally.
              For example, a head office can post nationally, while an entrepreneur with OctoCast can easily independently create and place local messages for his store.
              Naturally, our software is prepared for any desired screen size and video resolution.
