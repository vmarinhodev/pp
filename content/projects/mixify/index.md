              Mixins is a realistic, responsive web app which utilizes many of the main features of JavaScript. From a user's point of view, Mixins is an online Cocktail recipe book.

              This project is coded with Vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and CSS using a MVC pattern. The user can search for a drink recipe, the application fetches data from the "TheCocktailDB" API. 
              
              The user can then add the recipe to the favourites list for later access, this information will be saved on "localStorage".

              This was a fun project into the javaScript and API's fields.  Working on Mixins has given me the opportunity to really experiment with JavaScript and API's, and better understanding of how to apply them in a way that is effective and consistent.
              
              Although only a single page, I had the chance to learn how to create a library that can be integrated in different environments.
