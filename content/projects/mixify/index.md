      content: In addition to restating your thesis and highlighting your main points, you could add a relevant quotation from an authoritative source. This will not work in every case, but if, for example, you were writing a reflective essay on a piece of literature, you might quote a famous scholar who also reviewed that piece.It may be worth taking this opportunity to tie your argument to a larger context, such as relating your central theme to a particular group in society or even a global concept. McIntosh used this tactic in his conclusion by pitting America's capitalist society against his theory.
