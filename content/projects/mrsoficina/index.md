      subtitle: A means of communication

              MRS Oficina wanted a new website to show case their work, as the objects are handmade, we have taken great care to design each section of the site. 
              
              Straight from the homepage the site offers a fresh and lively universe that will encourage the user to explore.

              It was important to present the products and services in their best light. The images are simply accompained by discreet effects and beautiful typography. 
              
              For the project I used a setup that included a responsive grid, Gulp to compile Sass and minify assets, HTML / CSS & Javascript to design the interactions.
