      title:  What I am Doing at the moment
      content:  |
              At the present moment I am a Full Stack developer, turning ideas into practical software while creating intuitive and compelling interfaces and developing fast interactive front ends, using the latest technologies and techniques.
              
              My role involves transforming design mockups and wireframes into functional, efficient, and visually appealing components.
              I work closely with designers to ensure the user interface aligns with the intended user experience and design specifications.
              
              I leverage Reactâ€™s component-based architecture to build reusable, modular components that manage their own state and handle interactions.
              Efficient state management is key, so I use libraries like Redux or React's Context API to handle complex application states and ensure smooth data flow throughout the application.
              
              A significant part of my job is integrating APIs and working with backend developers to maintain seamless communication between the front and back ends.
              This involves fetching, updating, and manipulating data as needed.
              
              I also focus on performance optimization by continuously monitoring and improving the application.
              Techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and memoization help keep the app fast and efficient.
              
              Testing and debugging are essential for delivering stable, reliable applications, so I write unit and functional tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
              Collaboration is important in my role, so I work closely with backend developers, designers, product managers, and other stakeholders to create cohesive and efficient web applications.
              
              Continuous learning is a part of my work, as I stay up to date with the latest libraries, tools, and best practices to deliver top-quality results.
              I manage and track changes using version control systems like Git and may also be involved in deploying front-end applications using CI/CD pipelines.
              
              Overall, my role as a React frontend developer is to create high-quality, performant, and user-friendly web applications that meet the needs of users and stakeholders alike.

              In my projects, I leverage a comprehensive suite of modern tools and technologies to create scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Utilizing frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation, paired with React and TypeScript, I build robust front-end experiences that are both interactive and maintainable.
              
              Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn, ensuring visually appealing, accessible designs, while Zod and React Form streamline form validation and schema management. 
              
              On the back end, I work with Supabase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to manage authentication, databases, and storage efficiently.
              For state management and data fetching, I rely on tools like Redux, TanStack Query, and Axios to deliver seamless and real-time user experiences.
              
              My projects are structured with routers, high-order components, and React Hooks, allowing for modular and reusable code.
              Using platforms like Vercel and GitHub for CI/CD pipelines, I ensure smooth deployment workflows and maintain code integrity through Git version control.
              
              I adhere to Agile and Scrum methodologies to deliver features iteratively, with a focus on responsiveness and cross-device compatibility in all my designs.
              This tech stack enables me to create efficient, scalable, and modern solutions for diverse development challenges.
