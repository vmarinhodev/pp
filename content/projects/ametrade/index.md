              Ametrade was launched over 20 years ago and have established themselves as a leader organising world-class industry focused events. Their solutions serve over 100 thousand professionals around the world to showcase products and services. 
              
              I was brought on board to help put in place a more nimble and redundant development workflow and work with the team to define a more robust visual language for the brand.

      subtitle: Making it more immersive
      content: |
              During my time working for the company I have re-designed Ametrade online presence. A key aim was to deliver an outstanding & interactive online experience for users, one that allowed them to simply and quickly access information on AmeTrade services.
              
              I've implemented a Multisite setting so WordPress Core, plugins and themes updates, and user management can be done from one centralized place, instead of having the need to update each site separately.
