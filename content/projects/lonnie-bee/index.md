      content: |
              A professional graphic designer dreamed of a website to display her portfolio in a fun and dynamic way.
              
              The goal was to display several different design skills of her work in a minimal form and let the imagery be the main communicators.

      subtitle: Art Directing
      content: |
              In many projects, responsive images aren’t a technical issue but a strategic concern. Delivering different images to different screens is technically possible with srcset and sizes and element and Picturefill (or a similar) polyfill; but all of those variants of images have to be created, adjusted and baked into the logic of the existing CMS. 
              
              Any time we alter our images visually to fit a different context, we’re “art directing”. A resolution-adaptable image will look identical everywhere — it only resizes. An art-directed image changes in visually noticeable ways. Most of the time, that means cropping, either to fit a new layout or to keep the most important bits of the image visible when it’s viewed at small physical sizes.
              
              Art Direction Problem involves displaying different images for different screen sizes focussing on the important part of the image rather than just changing the resolution of the image.
